░▒▓ volleyd · the durable wave supervisor ▓▒░
```

`volleyd` is a long-running, non-LLM process that owns **waves**: sets of GitHub-issue tasks with
dependencies, each driven through a review pipeline by agents it supervises. It keeps an
append-only journal per wave, schedules the dependency graph, runs every external command through
a code-level authority fence, and publishes the live wave state to Volley topics so dashboards,
panes and coordinators can render it. It runs as a launchd service, so it outlives any
coordinator session.

> **Status: foundation (pre-release).** This package has the wave file, journal, reducer,
> scheduler, fence, config store, daemon skeleton, CLI and launchd service. Spawning agents,
> leases and pressure-based admission, the pipeline stages, decisions and recovery come in later
> tasks of the volleyd epic. Until then a submitted wave is journaled and its first tasks are
> *admitted*, but nothing is spawned: tasks stay `queued` with `why_waiting: "admitted: awaiting spawn"`.

## Quick start

From the repo root, after `bun install`:

```sh
# Validate a wave file (no daemon needed)
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts validate wave.yaml

# Run the daemon in the foreground (or `volleyd install` for launchd)
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts daemon

# In another terminal: submit and watch
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts run wave.yaml
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts status
```

State lives in `$VOLLEYD_HOME` (default `~/.volley/volleyd`). The broker and namespace come from
`--broker-url` / `--namespace` or `VOLLEY_BROKER_URL` / `VOLLEY_NAMESPACE`, like the `volley` CLI.

---

## The wave file

```yaml
wave: 2026-10-20-example            # wave id, [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}
repo: ~/repos/example
release_branch: release/2026-10-20-example
model: claude-opus-5-5
pipeline: [implement, [spec_review, quality_review], fixup, merge_ready]   # nested = parallel
tasks:
  T0: { issue: 101 }
  T1: { issue: 102, after: [T0] }
  T2: { issue: 103, after: [T0] }
  T3: { issue: 104, after: [T1, T2], pipeline: [implement, merge_ready] }
# optional:
# version: 1                 # bumped by a versioned re-submission
# namespace: dispatch        # Volley namespace for the wave's agents
# spawn_budget: 20           # default: spawn_budget_multiplier × task count
# heavy_pools: [backend-it]  # lease pools this wave's heavy commands draw from
# config: { hard_ceiling: 4 }  # per-wave overrides of any tunable (see Configuration)
```

Per task: `issue` (required), `after`, `pipeline`, `model`, `title`, and `files` (a scheduling hint:
paths the task will touch; tasks overlapping active ones start later).

The schema is [`spec/schemas/wave-file.schema.json`](../../spec/schemas/wave-file.schema.json).
The parser adds the rules a schema cannot express and reports everything with a path:

```
tasks.T3.after[1]: unknown task 'T9'
tasks.T1: duplicate task id 'T1'
tasks.T1.after: dependency cycle T1 -> T3 -> T2 -> T1
wave: invalid wave id (must match [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,62})
config.hard_ceiling: must be <= 100
```

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `volleyd daemon` | Run the supervisor in the foreground until SIGINT/SIGTERM. |
| `volleyd install [--dry-run]` | Write `~/Library/LaunchAgents/systems.volley.volleyd.plist` and `launchctl bootstrap` it. |
| `volleyd uninstall` | `launchctl bootout` the service and remove the plist (journals stay). |
| `volleyd run <wave.yaml> [--json]` | Validate locally, then submit to the daemon. Returns once the wave is journaled. |
| `volleyd validate <wave.yaml>` | Validate locally; exit 1 with path-qualified errors. |
| `volleyd status [wave] [--json]` | Wave state from the daemon. `--json` prints the exact `wave_state` payload. |
| `volleyd events <wave> --cursor <name>` | Print (JSONL) every journal event after the named cursor. Does not move it. |
| `volleyd ack <wave> --cursor <name> --seq <N>` | Advance the cursor to `N`. Ack **after** acting, so a crash replays. |
| `volleyd config get [path] [--wave <id>] [--json]` | Effective config (or one dotted path), optionally with a wave's overrides. |
| `volleyd config set <path> <value> [--by <who>]` | Change a tunable at runtime (validated, journaled, hot-applied). `<value>` is YAML. |

Commands that talk to the daemon fail fast with `volleyd not running` (exit 1, within ~1 s) when
the daemon's retained status is missing or terminal. `events`/`ack` read `$VOLLEYD_HOME` directly
and work while the daemon is down; use the wave `_system` for global events (`config_changed`).

## How it works

```
 wave.yaml ──validate──► run ──mailbox query──► daemon ──append──► journal.jsonl (fsync)
                                                  │                    │
                                                  │              reduce (pure)
                                                  │                    ▼
                                                  │              WaveRecord ──► scheduler.ready/admit
                                                  ▼
                                  volley/_waves/<wave>/state  (retained, after every append)
                                  volley/_waves/<wave>/events (live mirror)
```

- **Journal** (`src/journal.ts`): `$VOLLEYD_HOME/waves/<wave>/journal.jsonl`, one
  `{ seq, at, type, task?, data }` per line, `fsync` per append; `seq` starts at 1. A torn
  trailing write (crash mid-append) is truncated on open. A snapshot of the reduced record is
  written every 50 events, so a restart replays only the tail. Event types are the closed
  `wave-event` enum.
- **Reducer** (`src/reducer.ts`): pure `reduce(events) → WaveState` in exactly the
  `wave-state.schema.json` payload shape. Re-applying an already-applied `seq` is a no-op.
- **Scheduler** (`src/scheduler.ts`): `ready` = queued, not admitted, every `after` done; ordered
  by critical path length (longest downstream chain first), then by `files` overlap with active
  tasks, then id. `admit` takes an admission verdict `{ allow, reasons }` (pressure-based
  admission plugs in here later) and never exceeds the hard ceiling (live agents across all waves)
  or the wave's spawn budget. Lowering a limit admits nothing new and preempts nothing.
  Unadmitted ready tasks show the reasons in `why_waiting`, e.g. `hard ceiling reached: 2/2 live agents`.
- **Restart**: the daemon reopens every journal under `$VOLLEYD_HOME/waves/`, re-publishes each
  wave's state, and resumes admission.

## Topics and the control channel

| Topic | Retained | What |
|---|---|---|
| `volley/<ns>/volleyd/status` | yes | The daemon's lifecycle status; LWT flips it to `reaped` on a crash. |
| `volley/_system/registry/volleyd` | yes | Registry entry (`capabilities: ["supervisor"]`). |
| `volley/_waves/<wave>/state` | yes | Full `wave_state` snapshot (with `effective_config`), after every change. |
| `volley/_waves/<wave>/events` | no | Live mirror of each journal event. The journal is the record. |
| `volley/_waves/_config` | yes | Effective global config + `version` / `updated_at` / `updated_by`. |

**Control requests** go to the daemon's mailbox `volley/<ns>/volleyd/mailbox` as `type: "query"`
with a fresh `correlation_id` and `payload: { op, text, ... }`. The daemon answers on the sender's
own mailbox with `type: "ack"`, the same `correlation_id`, and
`payload: { text, acked_type: "query", op, ok, error?, result?, applied?, rejected? }`.

| `op` | Fields | `result` |
|---|---|---|
| `run` | `wave_yaml`, `source?` | the new wave state |
| `status` | `wave?` | one wave state, or `{ waves: [...] }` |
| `config_get` | `path?`, `wave?` | the value (the full retained payload when neither is given) |
| `config_set` | `patch`, `by` (SPEC §4.6.4) | `{ version }`, plus `applied` / `rejected: [{ path, reason }]` |

Later tasks add `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, `steer`, `resolve` and `claim`.

---

## Configuration

One model (T1's `config.schema.json`), three layers:

**built-in defaults** (`src/config-defaults.ts`) ← **`$VOLLEYD_HOME/config.yaml`** ← **the wave
file's `config:` block**.

The daemon validates `config.yaml` on load (a bad value fails startup naming the path), publishes
the effective global config retained on `volley/_waves/_config`, and every subsystem reads
tunables through the store — no tunable is a constant anywhere else (`test/no-constants.test.ts`).

`volleyd config set` (or any client sending `config_set`) is validated against the schema — an
unknown key or out-of-bounds value rejects the whole patch — then written to `config.yaml`
atomically, journaled as `config_changed { by, patch, previous, version }` in the `_system`
journal, re-published with `version + 1`, and applied **without a restart**:

| Tunable | Takes effect | In-flight work |
|---|---|---|
| `hard_ceiling`, `spawn_budget_multiplier` | next admission tick (immediately after the change) | never preempted; a limit below current use only stops new admissions |
| `admission.*` | next admission tick | never preempted |
| `lease_pools` | next lease grant | a pool shrunk below its holders stops granting until holders release; no holder is preempted |
| `claim_after_s`, `heartbeat_alarm_s`, `wake_grace_s` | next monitor tick | — |
| `fallback_model` | decisions opened after the change | open decisions keep their offer |
| `mailbox.session_expiry_s` | new connections only | existing sessions keep their expiry until they reconnect |
| `worktree_root` | spawns after the change | existing worktrees untouched |
| `spawn_timeout_s` | spawns after the change | — |

This foundation consumes `hard_ceiling` and `spawn_budget_multiplier`; the other rows describe
the contract the subsystems that read them (leases, monitors, decisions, spawning) follow.

## The authority fence

`src/exec.ts` is the only place volleyd spawns a child process (a test enforces it), and it calls
`assertAllowed(argv)` first. Denials throw `FENCE_DENIED` naming the verb. The deny list is checked
before the allow-list, so widening the allow-list can never silently un-deny a verb. The policy,
verbatim from `src/fence.ts`:

```
DENY (never, consent or not):
  git merge | push | rebase | reset --hard | branch -D/-d/--delete/-m/-M/-c/-C/--force
  gh pr merge | gh workflow run | gh repo delete | gh api with any method other than GET
  infrastructure CLIs: terraform, terragrunt, kubectl, helm, aws, gcloud, gsutil, az, pulumi,
    ansible, ansible-playbook, eksctl, doctl, flyctl
  docker rm | rmi | container rm | image rm | volume rm | network rm | system prune
  rm -rf (any spelling that combines -r/-R/--recursive with -f/--force)

CONSENT (denied unless a ConsentToken from `volleyd cleanup --yes` is passed):
  git worktree remove · cmux close-workspace

ALLOW:
  git [-C <dir>] [--no-pager] worktree add | fetch | rev-parse | log | diff | status |
    branch --list | merge-base | show   (diff/show without --output / --ext-diff)
  gh issue view · gh pr view | list | checks · gh run list | view | watch · gh api (GET only)
  cmux new-workspace | list-workspaces | send | send-key | read-screen | ping
  claude (any arguments)
  launchctl bootstrap | bootout | kickstart | print — only for the systems.volley.volleyd service
```

Anything else is denied — including shells (`bash -c`, `sh -c`), `env`/`sudo` wrappers, and git
global options other than `-C`/`--no-pager` (git config such as `-c alias.x=!…` can turn any
subcommand into an arbitrary command). `gh api` counts as a write when it sends fields (`-f`,
`-F`, `--input`) without an explicit `-X GET`.

volleyd never merges, never pushes, never touches infrastructure: it stops at merge-ready and a
human merges.

## Running as a service (launchd)

```sh
volleyd install               # writes the plist and loads it
volleyd install --dry-run     # print the plist instead
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/systems.volley.volleyd   # restart
volleyd uninstall             # unload + remove the plist
```

The plist (`launchd/systems.volley.volleyd.plist.tmpl`) runs `bun src/cli.ts daemon` with
`RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`, logs to `$VOLLEYD_HOME/volleyd.log`, and captures `VOLLEYD_HOME`,
`VOLLEY_BROKER_URL`, `VOLLEY_NAMESPACE` and your `PATH` (so `git`, `gh`, `cmux` and `claude`
resolve) at install time. Re-run `volleyd install` after changing any of them.

---

## Exit codes

Same table as `volley`: `0` success · `1` error (validation failure, daemon not running, broker
down, request rejected) · `2` usage error · `124` the daemon did not answer in time.
