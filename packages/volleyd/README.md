░▒▓ volleyd · the durable wave supervisor ▓▒░
```

`volleyd` is a long-running, non-LLM process that owns **waves**: sets of GitHub-issue tasks with
dependencies, each driven through a review pipeline by agents it supervises. It keeps an
append-only journal per wave, schedules the dependency graph, runs every external command through
a code-level authority fence, and publishes the live wave state to Volley topics so dashboards,
panes and coordinators can render it. It runs as a launchd service, so it outlives any
coordinator session.

> **Status: pre-release.** This package has the wave file, journal, reducer, scheduler, fence,
> config store, daemon, CLI and launchd service, heavy-operation leases and load-aware spawn
> admission. Spawning agents, the pipeline stages, decisions and recovery come in later tasks of
> the volleyd epic. Until then a submitted wave is journaled and its first tasks are *admitted*,
> but nothing is spawned: tasks stay `queued` with `why_waiting: "admitted: awaiting spawn"`.

## Quick start

From the repo root, after `bun install`:

```sh
# Validate a wave file (no daemon needed)
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts validate wave.yaml

# Run the daemon in the foreground (or `volleyd install` for launchd)
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts daemon

# In another terminal: submit and watch
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts run wave.yaml
bun packages/volleyd/src/cli.ts status
```

State lives in `$VOLLEYD_HOME` (default `~/.volley/volleyd`). The broker and namespace come from
`--broker-url` / `--namespace` or `VOLLEY_BROKER_URL` / `VOLLEY_NAMESPACE`, like the `volley` CLI.

---

## The wave file

```yaml
wave: 2026-10-20-example            # wave id, [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}
repo: ~/repos/example
release_branch: release/2026-10-20-example
model: claude-opus-5-5
pipeline: [implement, [spec_review, quality_review], fixup, merge_ready]   # nested = parallel
tasks:
  T0: { issue: 101 }
  T1: { issue: 102, after: [T0] }
  T2: { issue: 103, after: [T0] }
  T3: { issue: 104, after: [T1, T2], pipeline: [implement, merge_ready] }
# optional:
# version: 1                 # bumped by a versioned re-submission
# namespace: dispatch        # Volley namespace for the wave's agents
# spawn_budget: 20           # default: spawn_budget_multiplier × task count
# heavy_pools: [backend-it]  # lease pools this wave's heavy commands draw from
# config: { hard_ceiling: 4 }  # per-wave overrides of any tunable but lease_pools (see Configuration)
```

Per task: `issue` (required), `after`, `pipeline`, `model`, `title`, and `files` (a scheduling hint:
paths the task will touch; tasks overlapping active ones start later).

The schema is [`spec/schemas/wave-file.schema.json`](../../spec/schemas/wave-file.schema.json).
The parser adds the rules a schema cannot express and reports everything with a path:

```
tasks.T3.after[1]: unknown task 'T9'
tasks.T1: duplicate task id 'T1'
tasks.T1.after: dependency cycle T1 -> T3 -> T2 -> T1
wave: invalid wave id (must match [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,62})
config.hard_ceiling: must be <= 100
```

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `volleyd daemon` | Run the supervisor in the foreground until SIGINT/SIGTERM. |
| `volleyd install [--dry-run]` | Write `~/Library/LaunchAgents/systems.volley.volleyd.plist` and `launchctl bootstrap` it. |
| `volleyd uninstall` | `launchctl bootout` the service and remove the plist (journals stay). |
| `volleyd run <wave.yaml> [--json]` | Validate locally, then submit to the daemon. Returns once the wave is journaled. |
| `volleyd validate <wave.yaml>` | Validate locally; exit 1 with path-qualified errors. |
| `volleyd status [wave] [--json]` | Wave state from the daemon. `--json` prints the exact `wave_state` payload. |
| `volleyd events <wave> --cursor <name>` | Print (JSONL) every journal event after the named cursor. Does not move it. |
| `volleyd ack <wave> --cursor <name> --seq <N>` | Advance the cursor to `N`. Ack **after** acting, so a crash replays. |
| `volleyd config get [path] [--wave <id>] [--json]` | Effective config (or one dotted path), optionally with a wave's overrides. |
| `volleyd config set <path> <value> [--by <who>]` | Change a tunable at runtime (validated, journaled, hot-applied). `<value>` is YAML. |
| `volleyd admission [--json]` | The current spawn admission verdict: throttled or not, why, every pressure signal, per-wave verdicts. |

Commands that talk to the daemon fail fast with `volleyd not running` (exit 1, within ~1 s) when
the daemon's retained status is missing or terminal. `events`/`ack` read `$VOLLEYD_HOME` directly
and work while the daemon is down; use the wave `_system` for global events (`config_changed`,
`lease_*`).

---

## How it works

```
 wave.yaml ──validate──► run ──mailbox query──► daemon ──append──► journal.jsonl (fsync)
                                                  │                    │
                                                  │              reduce (pure)
                                                  │                    ▼
                                                  │              WaveRecord ──► scheduler.ready/admit
                                                  ▼
                                  volley/_waves/<wave>/state  (retained, after every append)
                                  volley/_waves/<wave>/events (live mirror)
```

- **Journal** (`src/journal.ts`): `$VOLLEYD_HOME/waves/<wave>/journal.jsonl`, one
  `{ seq, at, type, task?, data }` per line, `fsync` per append; `seq` starts at 1. A torn
  trailing write (crash mid-append) is truncated on open. A snapshot of the reduced record is
  written every 50 events, so a restart replays only the tail. Event types are the closed
  `wave-event` enum.
- **Reducer** (`src/reducer.ts`): pure `reduce(events) → WaveState` in exactly the
  `wave-state.schema.json` payload shape. Re-applying an already-applied `seq` is a no-op.
- **Scheduler** (`src/scheduler.ts`): `ready` = queued, not admitted, every `after` done; ordered
  by critical path length (longest downstream chain first), then by `files` overlap with active
  tasks, then id. `admit` takes an admission verdict `{ allow, reasons }` (pressure-based
  admission plugs in here later) and never exceeds the hard ceiling (live agents across all waves)
  or the wave's spawn budget. Lowering a limit admits nothing new and preempts nothing.
  Unadmitted ready tasks show the reasons in `why_waiting`, e.g. `hard ceiling reached: 2/2 live agents`.
- **Restart**: the daemon reopens every journal under `$VOLLEYD_HOME/waves/`, re-publishes each
  wave's state, and resumes admission.
- **One daemon per home**: `$VOLLEYD_HOME/volleyd.lock` (holding the pid) is taken before any
  journal is opened; a lock whose pid is gone is replaced. A second daemon is also refused while
  the broker shows a live `volleyd` status in the namespace.
- **Broker loss is fatal**: if the broker connection drops, `volleyd daemon` exits 1 and launchd's
  `KeepAlive` restarts it, which resumes the persistent session and restores every wave.

---

## Leases

A bare concurrency cap is the wrong tool: six agents editing files is fine, six running
integration suites with containers is not. Heavy commands therefore take a lease from a
machine-global **pool** (`lease_pools` in the config: `capacity`, optional `ttl_s`, and the
`match` regexes the [volley-hooks](../volley-hooks/README.md) lease hook uses to wrap matching Bash
commands in [`volley lease run`](../volley-cli/README.md#volley-lease)).

- **Requests** arrive on `volley/_system/leases/<pool>/requests` (`acquire | release | renew`,
  SPEC §4.6.5). A request whose `holder` is not the sender is ignored; a repeated `acquire` for a
  lease already held or queued is a no-op; `release` of a queued request cancels it.
- **Grants** are FIFO, never past the pool's *current* capacity. The pool state is re-published
  retained after every request, with `reasons` such as `queued: 3/3 backend-it leases held`.
- **A lease ends** on release, on TTL expiry (`ttl_s` of the request, else the pool's, else
  1 hour; `renew` restarts it — `volley lease run` renews at half the TTL), or when the holder's
  retained `status` turns `reaped`, `done` or `failed`.
- **Hot config, never preempt**: a capacity increase grants queued requests on the next tick; a
  decrease stops granting until holders release; a removed pool keeps its holders, drops its
  queued requests (they never started; each gets `rejected <lease_id>: pool <p> removed from
  config`, and `volley lease run` then runs its command unleased), reports capacity 0 with
  `pool <p> removed from config: new requests rejected`, rejects new acquires and disappears when
  its last holder releases. Pools are machine-global: they come only from the global config, and a
  wave file that sets `config.lease_pools` is rejected.
- **Durable**: every grant/release/expiry is journaled as `lease_requested`, `lease_granted`,
  `lease_released` or `lease_expired` in the `_system` journal (mirrored on
  `volley/_waves/_system/events`); a restart replays it, so held leases survive. Requests sent
  while the daemon is down wait in its persistent session and are handled on the next start
  (the daemon drains them like its mailbox).

## Spawn admission

Every tick (10 s) the daemon samples machine pressure through the fence (`src/pressure/*`) and
computes a pure verdict (`src/admission.ts`, `decide(samples, state, config) → { allow, reasons }`)
that the scheduler applies on top of the hard ceiling and spawn budget:

| Signal | Measured by | Over when (`admission.*`) |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_pressure` | `sysctl -n kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` (1 normal, 2 warn, 4 critical); `memory_pressure`'s free percentage as fallback | level > `memory_pressure_max_level` |
| `cmux_ping` | wall time of `cmux ping` (a ping that hangs counts as the time waited) | ms > `cmux_ping_max_ms` |
| `containers` | `docker info --format {{json .}}` → `ContainersRunning` | > `container_max` |
| `api_overload` | agents' progress (via the hooks): `awaiting_input` with `quota_auto_resume_*`, `idle` text matching `overloaded\|rate limit\|usage limit` | count in the last `api_overload_window_s` > `api_overload_max` |
| `ci_queue` | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs?status=queued` in the wave's repo → `total_count`, at most once a minute per repo (it spends the agents' GitHub API quota; ticks in between reuse the last sample) | > `ci_queue_max` |

- **Throttle starts only**: an over signal sets `allow` to 0; nothing running is touched.
- **Hysteresis**: after a breach a signal must be clear for `hysteresis_samples` consecutive
  samples (`recovering: cmux ping clear for 1/3 samples`) before the allowance rises again.
- **Unknown never throttles**: a tool that is missing (Linux has no memory-pressure sysctl, no
  cmux, docker or gh) makes its signal `unknown`. On a signal that is already recovering, an
  unknown sample counts toward the clean samples (`… clear for 2/3 samples (last sample
  unknown)`), so a tool that breaks after a breach cannot hold starts back forever.
- **Nothing starts before the first sample**: the daemon samples once before its first
  admission, so a daemon restarted on an overloaded machine does not admit every ready task.
- **Reasons everywhere**: the verdict's reasons become `why_waiting` on the wave's ready tasks
  (`memory pressure critical (level 4 > max 2)`), joined by the ceiling/budget reasons, and are
  published retained on `volley/_system/admission` (`spec/schemas/admission.schema.json`) with
  every signal's value and threshold. `volleyd admission` prints it.
- **Hot**: thresholds are read from the config store per wave (`config:` overrides apply); a
  `config_set` re-decides the last sample with the new thresholds immediately.

## Topics and the control channel

| Topic | Retained | What |
|---|---|---|
| `volley/<ns>/volleyd/status` | yes | The daemon's lifecycle status; LWT flips it to `reaped` on a crash. |
| `volley/_system/registry/volleyd` | yes | Registry entry (`capabilities: ["supervisor"]`). |
| `volley/_waves/<wave>/state` | yes | Full `wave_state` snapshot (with `effective_config`), after every change. |
| `volley/_waves/<wave>/events` | no | Live mirror of each journal event. The journal is the record. |
| `volley/_waves/_config` | yes | Effective global config + `version` / `updated_at` / `updated_by`. |
| `volley/_system/leases/<pool>` | yes | One lease pool: `capacity`, `held`, FIFO `queue`, `reasons`. |
| `volley/_system/leases/<pool>/requests` | no | Agents' `acquire` / `release` / `renew` (any agent may publish). |
| `volley/_system/admission` | yes | The spawn admission verdict after every pressure sample. |

**Control requests** go to the daemon's mailbox `volley/<ns>/volleyd/mailbox` as `type: "query"`
with a fresh `correlation_id` and `payload: { op, text, ... }`. The daemon answers on the sender's
own mailbox with `type: "ack"`, the same `correlation_id`, and
`payload: { text: "ACKED", acked_type: "query", op, ok, error?, result?, applied?, rejected? }`
— `ACKED` means received (SPEC §4.4); the outcome is `ok` / `applied` / `error`. A query without a
`correlation_id` is dropped (an ack must carry one). A redelivered request (same sender and
`correlation_id`) is answered again from memory, not re-run.

The daemon keeps its mailbox in a **persistent MQTT session** (`clean: false`, stable clientId
`volley-volleyd-daemon-<ns>`, MQTT 5 with `mailbox.session_expiry_s`), so a request sent while it
is restarting is delivered when it comes back. Mailbox messages are never retained: the daemon
clears a stray retained message on its mailbox at startup instead of executing it.

| `op` | Fields | `result` |
|---|---|---|
| `run` | `wave_yaml`, `source?` | the new wave state |
| `status` | `wave?` | one wave state, or `{ waves: [...] }` |
| `config_get` | `path?`, `wave?` | the value (the full retained payload when neither is given) |
| `config_set` | `patch`, `by` (SPEC §4.6.4) | `{ version }`, plus `applied` / `rejected: [{ path, reason }]` |
| `admission` | — | the retained admission summary (null before the first sample) |

Later tasks add `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, `steer`, `resolve` and `claim`.

---

## Configuration

One model (T1's `config.schema.json`), three layers:

**built-in defaults** (`src/config-defaults.ts`) ← **`$VOLLEYD_HOME/config.yaml`** ← **the wave
file's `config:` block**.

The daemon validates `config.yaml` on load (a bad value fails startup naming the path), publishes
the effective global config retained on `volley/_waves/_config`, and every subsystem reads
tunables through the store — no tunable is a constant anywhere else (`test/no-constants.test.ts`).

`volleyd config set` (or any client sending `config_set`) is validated against
`config-set-request.schema.json` and the merged result against the config schema — an unknown
key, an out-of-bounds value or an empty sub-object rejects the whole patch; a patch may set one
field of an existing object, e.g. `lease_pools.build.ttl_s` — then written to `config.yaml`
atomically, journaled as `config_changed { by, patch, previous, version }` in the `_system`
journal (mirrored live on `volley/_waves/_system/events`), re-published with `version + 1`, and applied **without a restart**:

| Tunable | Takes effect | In-flight work |
|---|---|---|
| `hard_ceiling`, `spawn_budget_multiplier` | next admission tick (immediately after the change) | never preempted; a limit below current use only stops new admissions |
| `admission.*` | next admission tick | never preempted |
| `lease_pools` | next lease grant | a pool shrunk below its holders stops granting until holders release; no holder is preempted |
| `claim_after_s`, `heartbeat_alarm_s`, `wake_grace_s` | next monitor tick | — |
| `fallback_model` | decisions opened after the change | open decisions keep their offer |
| `mailbox.session_expiry_s` | new connections only | existing sessions keep their expiry until they reconnect |
| `worktree_root` | spawns after the change | existing worktrees untouched |
| `spawn_timeout_s` | spawns after the change | — |

The scheduler consumes `hard_ceiling` and `spawn_budget_multiplier`, the lease book
`lease_pools`, and admission `admission.*`; the other rows describe the contract the subsystems
that read them (monitors, decisions, spawning) follow. [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml)
lists every key with its default and example pools, commented out.

## The authority fence

`src/exec.ts` is the only place volleyd spawns a child process (a test enforces it), and it calls
`assertAllowed(argv)` first. Denials throw `FENCE_DENIED` naming the verb. The deny list is checked
before the allow-list, so widening the allow-list can never silently un-deny a verb. The policy,
verbatim from `src/fence.ts`:

```
DENY (never, consent or not):
  git merge | push | rebase | reset --hard | branch -D/-d/--delete/-m/-M/-c/-C/--force
  gh pr merge | gh workflow run | gh repo delete | gh api with any method other than GET
  infrastructure CLIs: terraform, terragrunt, kubectl, helm, aws, gcloud, gsutil, az, pulumi,
    ansible, ansible-playbook, eksctl, doctl, flyctl
  docker rm | rmi | container rm | image rm | volume rm | network rm | system prune
  rm -rf (any spelling that combines -r/-R/--recursive with -f/--force)

CONSENT (denied unless a ConsentToken from `volleyd cleanup --yes` is passed):
  git worktree remove · cmux close-workspace

ALLOW (program by bare name only — never a path):
  git [-C <dir>] [--no-pager] worktree add | fetch | rev-parse | log | diff | status |
    branch --list | merge-base | show
  gh issue view · gh pr view | list | checks · gh run list | view | watch · gh api (GET only)
  cmux new-workspace | list-workspaces | send | send-key | read-screen | ping
  claude (any arguments)
  launchctl bootstrap | bootout | kickstart [-k] [-p] | print — only for the
    systems.volley.volleyd service
  pressure samplers, exact argv only: sysctl -n kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level ·
    memory_pressure (no arguments: report only) · docker info --format {{json .}}

OPTIONS: every git and gh subcommand above has an exact option allow-list (GIT_SPECS and
GH_SPECS in src/fence.ts); any other option is denied — e.g. `fetch --upload-pack`/`-u`,
`--exec`, `--receive-pack`, `--config`, `--output`, `--ext-diff`, `--textconv`,
`gh api --hostname`, `--input`, `-F`. Bundled short flags and git global options other than `-C`/`--no-pager`
(`-c`, `--config-env`, `--exec-path`) are denied, as are subcommand aliases and `fetch`
transport-helper URLs (`ext::…`).
```

Anything else is denied — including shells (`bash -c`, `sh -c`), `env`/`sudo` wrappers, a path
as the program (`/tmp/x/git`), and git global options other than `-C`/`--no-pager` (git config
such as `-c alias.x=!…` can turn any subcommand into an arbitrary command). Each allowed git and
gh subcommand accepts only the options listed for it in `src/fence.ts`; an option that takes a
value must have it attached (`--depth=1`) or as a next argument that does not start with `-`, so
the fence and the tool always agree on where an option starts. `gh api` counts as a write when
it sends fields (`-f`) without an explicit `-X GET`. The wave-file schema also forbids a leading
`-` in `repo` and `release_branch`, so neither can ever be read as an option.

volleyd never merges, never pushes, never touches infrastructure: it stops at merge-ready and a
human merges.

## Running as a service (launchd)

```sh
volleyd install               # writes the plist and loads it
volleyd install --dry-run     # print the plist instead
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/systems.volley.volleyd   # restart
volleyd uninstall             # unload + remove the plist
```

The plist (`launchd/systems.volley.volleyd.plist.tmpl`) runs `bun src/cli.ts daemon` with
`RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`, logs to `$VOLLEYD_HOME/volleyd.log`, and captures `VOLLEYD_HOME`,
`VOLLEY_BROKER_URL`, `VOLLEY_NAMESPACE` and your `PATH` (so `git`, `gh`, `cmux` and `claude`
resolve) at install time. Re-run `volleyd install` after changing any of them.

---

## Exit codes

Same table as `volley`: `0` success · `1` error (validation failure, daemon not running, broker
down, request rejected) · `2` usage error · `124` the daemon did not answer in time.
